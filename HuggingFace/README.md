# HuggingFace
Tutorial on Hugging Face based on the [official Hugging Face course, 2022](https://huggingface.co/course
). Online accessed February 2023 under Apache 2 license.

This course will teach you about some of the ingredients of the Hugging Face ecosystem, Datasets, Tokenizers and Transformers, through a set of hands-on Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks assume that you are familiar with Python, Pytorch, ML, NLP and Transformer models. I also assume that you are familiar with Clab, otherwise you can take a look at <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/probml-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/colab_intro.ipynb">Kevin Murphy's intro to Colab</a>.
